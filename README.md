# htxarchive
Scratchpad for ideas, I want to eventually build an events page for the local houston punk/hardcore/metal/indie scene and use that as an excuse to learn modern react and generally level up my fullstack skills.

For now, I'm going to start small. One thing that has always bummed me out is how ephemeral venues and their webpages are. This script aims to send event listing urls to archive.org's wayback machine to store for posterity.
